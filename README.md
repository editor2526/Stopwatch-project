# Stopwatch-project
Draggable Stopwatch timer in Html format. You can drag and drop it across the screen, move it around.

- Created by looking up strings from tutorials
- Compared strings/functions/variables/etc to tutorial videos how to combine
- Click and drag function added by myself, improvised.
- in Html format, not as a standalone .JS file
- Hand-written and ideas combined from out of own initiatives, mini-project.
